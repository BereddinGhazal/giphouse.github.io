#### NGSD

NGSD is short for _New Generation Software Development_, and is project in which we develop a new domain-specific business-oriented programming language. The language must be understandable for business owners that do not have any programming experience.

The language and system we are developing, is based on SPADE of CGI, and uses the what, when and where-principle: **What** has to be the result of the business process? **When** does it have to be ready? **Where** is the required information coming from?
