#### ATHENA

The Athena website will serve as a portal to information about flora and fauna. The Athena portal will hold information on historical 
contexts of human â€“ nature relationships for a broad variety of plant and animal species and the landscapes and ecosystems they live(d)
in. ATHENA does so by linking existing databases, requesting information from API's and using webcrawlers.
