## Radboud Sustainability Dasboard

#### Introduction

RSD is an administration tool for the Facility Service of the Radboud University. The aim is to support the Facility Service in complying with the dutch law in respect to renewable energy, toxic chemicals, heating installations and so on.

#### Framework

As this application is mainly a database with a user friendly front-end, we use the Python framework Django, as this framework is ideal for defining database models. On top of that, there is a complete admin area built just based on the defined information models. This makes that the user can later always change every detail in the database, even if these attributes can't be changed via the 'real' front-end.

#### Use

The application will be used by employees of the Facility Service of the RU. The aim is to extend the application such that there is an option for guest users. These are mostly contractors outside the RU.
