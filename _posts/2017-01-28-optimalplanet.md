#### Optimal Planet
Optimal Planet is a company founded by Dr. Reinier de Nooij. 
This company offers an online tool to scan the durability of suppliers, services and products using questionnaires (Optimal SCANS).
The Optimal Planet project has been a part of GiPHouse for 3 years now. 
Optimal SCANS enables companies to make accounts, e.g. for suppiers, that can answer the questionnaires.
The results of the suppliers can then be analyzed and exported to PDF file format.
Using user-friendly analysis tools like tables and graphs, companies can use the results to choose a supplier that suits them best.
