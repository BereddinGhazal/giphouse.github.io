#### IntelliGUI

<b>CGI</b>

CGI, a  global information technology (IT) consulting company founded in 1976 in Canada, has created a new generation of software development. The tool SPADE and the method SMART Requirements 2.0 allows one to increase the speed of the development of software. 

<b>IntelliGUI</b>

IntelliGUI is a project with the goal to create a user interface that can be designed automatically. This is done through three mechanisms:
- Auto design
Screens are designed and created automatically at run-time based on the functionality of the task the user needs to perform.
- User adaptation
The users are able to change the screen at run-time.
- Auto adaptation
Screens automatically change depending on the situation.

This AngularJS project was already partially implemented, so we focused on the auto adaptation part during this semester.

<b>Functionality</b>

The app integrates with GitHub, allowing the user to sign in with his account. His differents tasks then are displayed as a list of blocks. He can change the order of the tasks and resize, drag and move elements,which we call widget (combobox, text field, radio buttons, image, tableâ€¦) inside its task. 
The auto adaptation consist of improving the ergonomy for the user. For example, a table can be show as a bar chart, or a Google map if the table is a table of coordinates.
